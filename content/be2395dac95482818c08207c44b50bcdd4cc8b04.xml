&#13;
The Nodemailer module can be downloaded and installed using npm:&#13;
&#13;
C:\Users\Your Name&gt;npm install nodemailer&#13;
After you have downloaded the Nodemailer module, you can include the module in any application:&#13;
&#13;
var nodemailer = require('nodemailer');&#13;
Send an Email&#13;
Now you are ready to send emails from your server.&#13;
&#13;
Use the username and password from your selected email provider to send an email. This tutorial will show you how to use your Gmail account to send an email:&#13;
&#13;
Example&#13;
var nodemailer = require('nodemailer');&#13;
&#13;
var transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({&#13;
  service: 'gmail',&#13;
  auth: {&#13;
    user: 'youremail@gmail.com',&#13;
    pass: 'yourpassword'&#13;
  }&#13;
});&#13;
&#13;
var mailOptions = {&#13;
  from: 'youremail@gmail.com',&#13;
  to: 'myfriend@yahoo.com',&#13;
  subject: 'Sending Email using Node.js',&#13;
  text: 'That was easy!'&#13;
};&#13;
&#13;
transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, function(error, info){&#13;
  if (error) {&#13;
    console.log(error);&#13;
  } else {&#13;
    console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response);&#13;
  }&#13;
});&#13;
And that's it! Now your server is able to send emails.&#13;
&#13;
Multiple Receivers&#13;
To send an email to more than one receiver, add them to the "to" property of the mailOptions object, separated by commas:&#13;
&#13;
Example&#13;
Send email to more than one address:&#13;
&#13;
var mailOptions = {&#13;
  from: 'youremail@gmail.com',&#13;
  to: 'myfriend@yahoo.com, myotherfriend@yahoo.com',&#13;
  subject: 'Sending Email using Node.js',&#13;
  text: 'That was easy!'&#13;
}&#13;
Send HTML&#13;
To send HTML formatted text in your email, use the "html" property instead of the "text" property:&#13;
&#13;
Example&#13;
Send email containing HTML:&#13;
&#13;
var mailOptions = {&#13;
  from: 'youremail@gmail.com',&#13;
  to: 'myfriend@yahoo.com',&#13;
  subject: 'Sending Email using Node.js',&#13;
  html: '&lt;h1&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was easy!&lt;/p&gt;'&#13;
