<article><question>email to it deptt</question><answer>As conveyed earlier :&#13;
i am having a company issued macbook pro etc ... which was damaged in a minor &#13;
accident in my house. The machine is functional but there is a dent in the screen frame which might cause problems &#13;
in the future. As suggested by the {{whoever}} that the IT deptt would pick it up and replace it and return it back.&#13;
But, the issue is that, I am currently living in bokaro steel city ,  jharkhand and there might be some problems&#13;
 for the IT team with regards to travel and accessibility. &#13;
I would like to know if it'd be ok to get my macbook repaired {{by the whatever }}  and then reimburse the necessary amount &#13;
later. It would be convenient for everyone if that could happen since setting up a new machine might be tedious. Should I get it repaired by myself &#13;
or it is absolutely necessary that the IT guys do it. &#13;
&#13;
Nonetheless, I trust you with the right decision.&#13;
&#13;
